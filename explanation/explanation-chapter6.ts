// chapter 6; setting up the database.

// Before you can continue working on your dashboard, you'll need some data. In this chapter, you'll be setting up a PostgreSQL database from one of Vercel's marketplace integrations. If you're already familiar with PostgreSQL and would prefer to use your own database provider, you can skip this chapter and set it up on your own. Otherwise, let's continue!

// In this chapter...

// Here are the topics weâ€™ll cover

// Push your project to GitHub.

// Set up a Vercel account and link your GitHub repo for instant previews and deployments.

// Create and link your project to a Postgres database.

// // Seed the database with initial data.
